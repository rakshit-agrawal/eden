QRH has two layers of extension over eden:

1. Views based layer.
2. Crowdsourced communication

1. Views based layer.
    - We have layers of easy access views and forms
    - These make use of standard eden data tables underneath but provide some top level solutions to
      make these tasks easier
    - Based on the type of host option being used, we have pre-population options

2. Crowdsourced communication
    - Every instance is holding some communication with a base url
    - It keeps on mapping data stored locally with data stored at server level
    - It follows the queuing setup described in our paper
